Excited to announce that my paper on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Point-and-Click UIs has been accepted for publication in Proc. ACM Human-Computer Interaction and will be presented at EICS this June! Our approach formulates interface adaptation as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem, facilitating the development of adaptive interfaces across various tasks with minimal adjustments needed.
