I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [ETH Z端rich](https://ethz.ch), working under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges) in the [AIT Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch). My interest lies in exploring the dynamics of human interactions with intelligent systems, such as user interfaces and robots. My research intersects Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction, concentrating on integrating models of human behavior into intelligent control strategies. In my work, I develop algorithms and methodologies that not only predict and approximate human behavior but also apply these insights to the control of intelligent interactive systems. Before my Ph.D. at ETH Z端rich, I completed a joint M.Sc degree in Computer Science, specializing in intelligent systems, from [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi) and the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/). Additionally, I hold a B.Sc degree in Industrial Design from [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://tue.nl).
