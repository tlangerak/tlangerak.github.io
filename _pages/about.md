I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi), where I work with [Prof. Dr. Antti Oulasvirta](https://users.aalto.fi/~oulasvir/) in the [Computational Behavior Lab](https://cbl.aalto.fi/). I work on the modelling of human behavior via Reinforcement Learning. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch), working under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges) in the [AIT Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch). In my research I explore the dynamics of human interactions with intelligent systems, such as user interfaces and robots. My research intersects Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction, concentrating on integrating models of human behavior into intelligent control strategies. In my work, I develop algorithms and methodologies that not only predict and approximate human behavior but also apply these insights to the control of intelligent interactive systems. Before my Ph.D. at ETH Zürich, I completed a joint M.Sc degree in Computer Science, specializing in intelligent systems, from [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi) and the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/). Additionally, I hold a B.Sc degree in Industrial Design from [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://tue.nl).
