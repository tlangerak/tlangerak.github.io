I am a postdoctoral researcher at  [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi), working in the [Computational Behavior Lab](https://cbl.aalto.fi/) with [Prof. Dr. Antti Oulasvirta](https://users.aalto.fi/~oulasvir/). My research focuses on modeling human behavior using Reinforcement Learning to better understand and improve interactions with intelligent systems.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch), where I worked under [Prof. Dr. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges) in the [AIT Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch). My work lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), aiming to integrate models of human behavior into intelligent control strategies for user interfaces, robotics, and adaptive systems. I develop algorithms that not only predict human behavior but also optimize interactions for more natural and efficient user experiences.

Before my Ph.D., I completed a joint M.Sc. in Computer Science, specializing in intelligent systems, from [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi) and the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/). My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Industrial Design from [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://tue.nl), giving me a strong foundation in both design thinking and computational methods.

Through my research, I strive to bridge the gap between AI and human behavior, making intelligent systems more adaptive, intuitive, and human-centered.
