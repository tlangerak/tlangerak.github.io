I am interested in exploring the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning. My current research is focused on adaptive user interfaces from a multi-agent Reinforcement Learning perspective. In the past I built custom hardware for input and output devices, and developed novel control strategies for haptic interactions.
